# ASD-Diagnostics
This project implements a comprehensive machine learning pipeline detecting Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in adults. It involves preprocessing and exploring autism screening datasets, applying feature engineering, and training multiple classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees, SVM, Neural Networks, and KNN).
